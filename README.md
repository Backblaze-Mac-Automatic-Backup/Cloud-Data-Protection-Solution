Backblaze provides a comprehensive and user-friendly Cloud Data Protection Solution. It is engineered to offer effortless, set-and-forget backup for personal computers. Once installed, it automatically identifies new and changed files, then securely transmits them to off-site data centers. This ensures your valuable digital life is protected against local disasters like fire, flood, or ransomware.

The platform is built with simplicity and power in mind. Users benefit from unlimited data storage capacity, robust end-to-end encryption, and flexible restore options, including downloading via zip files or receiving a restored hard drive by mail. Backblaze maintains version history for your files, allowing you to roll back to previous states. Its lightweight design ensures it runs efficiently without slowing down your system, making it the premier choice for reliable, automatic, and secure data preservation for everyone from home users to professionals.
